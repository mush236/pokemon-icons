Icons for Scarlet & Violet Pokémon

Pokémon sprite icons are taken from the [National Pokédex Version Delta Project](https://www.deviantart.com/mbcmechachu/art/National-Pokedex-Icon-Dex-824897934) and resized to 68x56 pixels to conform with the [PokéSprite](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite) project icons so as to look cohesive when used together.
